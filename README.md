## DynamicServices

### Overview
DynamicServices is a suit of web-services to run containerized algorithms on large bio-medical image data. It can used to run the algorithm on a region of interest (ROI) tile or on the whole image.  

### Architecture assumptions
DynamicServices pulls an image ROI from an image server based on JSON orders. The following describes the workflow and underground architecture assumptions. 

### Dependencies:
* `yum install curl-devel`
* `yum install jsoncpp-devel` or use http://ask.xmodulo.com/fix-fatal-error-jsoncpp.html
* Install redox: `https://github.com/hmartiro/redox`

### Build:
* `mkdir obj`
* `make`

### Config file
Refer to sample_config.json

### Deployment
#### Dependencies
DynamicServices requires following tools installed and setup

##### Camicroscope (Dependency)
* Install all components of camicroscope from (https://github.com/camicroscope/Distro)
  * In `config.json` update `annotations.server` and `annotations.redis` to IP address of Loader container.
  * Set the API key in `api_key_file` as the API key of Bindaas(from Data container)
* Install Kue(https://github.com/Automattic/kue) and redis on the host machine. 
  * In `config.json` updated `orders.kue` and `orders.redis` with host and port of kue and redis.
  * Configure camicroscope viewer in `/Configuration/api/config.php` set ordering service as this Kue.

To run use:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/ ./dynamicservices config.json`
To deploy using nohup:
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/ nohup ./dynamicservices config.json > dynamicservices.log &`

##### Deployment inside an algorithm docker container
To deploy inside an algorithm docker container. Take alogorithm image as base and use the given Dockerfile to build a new image with DynamicServices installed inside it. The given Dockerfile uses `sbubmi/test_segmentation:latest` as the base image.

* Build the docker image `docker build -t dynamic_services_segmentation .`
* Create a new directory (let's call it `configs`)
* Update and place `config.json` & `api_key.json` inside `configs`
* Run the container using `docker run --net="host" -itd -v <path_to_configs>:/tmp/DynamicServices/configs dynamic_services_segmentation`
* Make sure that all the entries in config.json are updated. `"api_key_file"` should have the complete path inside the docker container.
* To check the log of DynamicServices use `tail -f configs/dynamicservices.log`

### Algorithm execution pipeline
As soon as DynamicServices gets a notification about a new job on orders' Redis, it fetces the order from Kue for that job id. The order json is used to extract the case_id, subject_id and ROI information along with other algorithm parameters. DynamicServices then fetches the ROI using an image service and runs the algorithm on the tile with all the paramaters. The resultant zip file is then posted to the annotations server.
